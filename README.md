## Introduction

The Guessing Game is a simple Java application that challenges the user to guess a number between 1 and 100. The application provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low and continues until the user correctly guesses the number. It then displays the number of attempts it took to win the game. The application was developed using Java Swing and AWT for the graphical user interface, and it was built in Visual Studio Code.

## Features

- Random number generation between 1 and 100.
- User-friendly interface created with Java Swing and AWT.
- Provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
- Displays the number of attempts once the correct number is guessed.
